One function of an operating system is to control system performance. The OS periodically monitors over the system to ensure healthy performance. It will continue to monitor and record operation times and response to have a complete view of system health. This information is used to increase performance.
Another function of an operating system is memory management. Operating systems manages Primary memory and Main memory in order for the computer to operate properly. When programs begin and ends the memory needed to use those programs get allocated accordingly based on whats being used. The operating system will allocate memory when a program is being used and also deallocates memory when a program terminates.
